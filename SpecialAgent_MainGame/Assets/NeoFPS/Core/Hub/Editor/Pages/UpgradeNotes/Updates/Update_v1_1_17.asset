    h3Heading: New Features
    bulletPoints:
    - New first person body features for full character body and separate arms vs
      weapon
    - Root motion based movement states and motion graph behaviour
    - Wieldable item kinematics adds IK hand matching between character and weapons
    - Procedural spine animation to match aim pitch and yaw
    - Camera transform constraints to match first person camera to character head
      or weapon
    - LockSelectionOnDeath component forces character to lower weapon on death
    - New motion graph behaviours (AlignWithVelocity, ConstrainCharacterHeading,
      FootIkBehaviour, SetRootMotionStrength, SpineAim, AnimatorGroundSlopeBehaviour)
    - New motion graph conditions (InventoryItemCondition, WieldableSelectedCondition)
    - DeathAnimation component triggers an animation when the player character dies
    - Added custom inputs to InputCharacterMotion component
    - All firearm modules and wieldables now support multiple animators (including
      character)
    - Extended and improved HealToolAction fir wieldable tools

    h3Heading: Component Changes
    bulletPoints:
    - Added new Vehicle input context and re-generated. Any custom scripts that expose
      InputContext properties will need to have the value reset
    - Changed motion graph animation from using Animator as a transform parameter
      in the graph to a property on the motion controller
    - Added New Game button to sample UI main menu (set to open demo facility scene
      by default)
    - Added Default layer to interactions mask so that objects on default layer can
      occlude interactables
    - Changed interrupt behaviour on wieldable tools and added new options. Check
      any tools for changes
