    bulletPoints:
    - New v7 input system extension package to match new input changes
    - InputInventory (and InputSystemInventory) now allow you to specify quick slot
      inputs to allow better quick use items
    - HudInventoryStandardPC now lets you specify which quick slots are displayed
    - CheckpointTrigger components now require a NeoSerializedGameObject component
      on the same object as they save data that prevents triggering immediately on
      load
    - SimpleReloader and ChamberedReloader now have separate settings for reload
      time vs blocking time. Existing uses should pick up the existing reload time
      setting for blocking too
