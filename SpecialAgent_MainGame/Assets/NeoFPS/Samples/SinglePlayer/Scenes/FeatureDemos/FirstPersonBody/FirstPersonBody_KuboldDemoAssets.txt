INSTALLATION

1. Download and import the Kubold animsets above (you only need the contents of the "Animations" folders. The rest does not need importing).
2. Extract the demo package (a folder called Kubold will be added to the demo folder)
3. Open the demo scene
4. Locate the "SimpleSpawnerAndGameMode" object in the scene
5. On the "Fps Solo Game Minimal" component, set the "Character Prefab" property to point at one of the 2 character prefabs in the Kubold folder

CONTENTS

The package contains 4 items:
- The CharacterAnimator is an example animator controller that uses a combination of animation clips from the movement and rifle animset pro assets, as well as some NeoFPS animations.
- The FullBodyCharacter is a character prefab with the arms built into the character instead of the weapons. It has a follow cam built in that shows an external view of the character in the top right of the screen so that you can see how it looks.
- The NoArmsCharacter is a character with torso and legs that you can see when you look down. This requires weapons with animated arms built in.
